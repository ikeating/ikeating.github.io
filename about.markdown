My name is Isaiah Keating, and I am currently residing with my wife, one kid, and a dog in
Canby, MN. I received my AAS in Law Enforcement from Hibbing Tech in 1995 and just 
recently received my Liberal Arts degree from Minnesota West.  I have been working as a 
full-time peace officer in Minnesota for twenty-three years. Iâ€™ve held the position of 
Chief of Police for the City of Canby, MN since 2000.  I am currently attending DSU to 
obtain a BS in computer science.  My hobbies include scuba, ham radio, electronics and 
monkeying around with microcontrollers.
