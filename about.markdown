My name is Isaiah Keating and I currently live in Grand Rapids, MN. I received my AAS in Law Enforcement from Hibbing Tech in 1995 and received my Liberal Arts degree from Minnesota West.  I have been working as a full-time peace officer in Minnesota for twenty-three years. Iâ€™ve held the position of Chief of Police for the City of Canby, MN since 2000.  I am currently attending DSU to obtain a BS in computer science.  My hobbies include scuba, ham radio, electronics and monkeying around with microcontrollers.
