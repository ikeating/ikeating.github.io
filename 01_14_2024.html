        <p>12/01/2024 & 13/01/2024 & 14/01/2024 Fenix HM50R & HM50R V2<br><br>

    This is a product review of the best headlamp I have had the pleasure of using, the Fenix HM50R. I also want to compare it to the updated HM50R V2 that I have on order.  Upon starting this review, I got a little hung up on worrying about listing all the specifications.  Anyone can look up the specifications, so I’ll stick with my observations and leave it at that.<br>
    The HM50R is small, while wearing it I barely notice it.  It doesn’t move around on your head and the headband has a sticky silicone material that helps it stay put.  The 500-lumen output is more than enough light.  The headlamp has low, medium, high, and turbo brightness settings.  I normally find low and medium brightness is all I need.<br>
     Fenix recommends the 16340 rechargeable Li-ion battery or one CR123A Lithium battery for the HM50R.  The headlamp has a Micro USB terminal for charging.  The max charging current is 700mA, and the charging time is about 1.5 hours.  Fenix also states it’s capable of withstanding temperatures down to -40º (CR123's ONLY).  Fenix states the follow for checking the status of the battery “With the headlamp switched off, single click the switch to display the battery level for 3 seconds in different colors: Green constant on: more than 80%, Green flashes: 50% - 80%, Blue constant on: 20% - 50%, Blue flashes: less than 20%.”<br>
    I have the new HM50R version two on order and have found the following differences with the first version.<br>
    Version two is advertised as having a red light and flashing red light both of which the original doesn’t have. The light output in lumens for the new model is low 30, medium 130, high 400, and turbo is 700 lumens.<br>
    Fenix recommends the Fenix ARB-L16-700P Li-ion battery, 16340 rechargeable li-ion battery, for version two.  Fenix states the following concerning the use of CR123A batteries, “CR123A Lithium battery is not recommended. As some modes fail to light up due to circuit limitation, and only Low mode is available when the battery level is low, so it is not recommended to use CR123A under non-emergency situations”.  The version two has a USB C port for charging.
