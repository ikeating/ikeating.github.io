        <p>06/01/2024 Journal entry for the day<br>

    Busy day so I’ve decided to do a journal entry. Woke up a bit late and after getting ready for the day I made a plan for Andrew and I to run into town for a few errands.  Tiff made some tasty quesadillas for me that got me going.
    We had a much welcomed four to five inches of snowfall Friday night.  I snow blew the driveway, swept off the vehicles, and started up Andrew’s Trailblazer for some winter weather drivers training.  Andrew wasn’t really excited about driving but he was a trooper and agreed to the plan.<br>
    Andrew drove us to L&M where we bought a new ice fishing rod, some ice fishing accessories, and a poly snow shovel for the deck.  After leaving L&M, I noticed we had zero gas so we made a pit stop at Cenex for some badly needed gas.  We then drove over to the Pokegama Lake store for some propane and shiners.  Andrew did a great job driving on the slippery roads and we made it home without incident!
    I then hastily made my way out to the lake for some ice fishing.  I walked out to sandbar point.  I was pleased to find that the walk wasn’t that bad and I was able to get myself on the point with my Garmin GPS.  I didn’t have any luck and it started to get windy and snowed quite a bit.  Andrew and Willow walked out to visit me.<br> 
    After returning home, I grilled some pre-seasoned chuck-eye steaks Tiff got from S&S meats.  We have been really pleased with the chuck-eyes!  I then used our new snow shovel and had a great time shoveling off the deck.  I’m so glad I replaced the old deck boards which makes shoveling so much easier.
