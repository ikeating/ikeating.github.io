        <p>07/01/2024 Gerber MP600 multiplier<br><br>

    I have never written a product review so today I thought I’d give it a try!  Up for review is a black anodized Gerber MP600 multiplier that was issued to me by the US Corps of Engineers when I was employed in the summer of 2023 as a park ranger at Pokegama Dam.  I’m not sure why they choose this model other than the MP600 is advertised as being issued to the armed forces.  Gerber list it as product number 07550 and has a list price of $90.00.<br>
    Closed, the multiplier is five and one-eighth inches long and six and five-eighths inches when the pliers are extended.  The pliers open to approximately fifty-five degrees and the handles open to approximately sixty-one degrees.  Gerber list the tool’s weight as nine ounces.<br>
    The multiplier contains a short needle nose pliers that contain a wire cutter and crimper.  The pliers are accessible by snapping the tool with your wrist causing the pliers to slide out the pivot end of the two handles and lock.  The pliers can be retracted by pushing in two spring loaded push pins located on either side of the two handles and then slid back in-between the two handles.  The pliers, cutter, and crimper have worked as expected with no issues.<br>
    The Gerber multiplier has two handles that both contain various fold out tools.  One handle has an imperial three-inch ruler stamped into the side and the other handle has a metric eight-centimeter ruler stamped into the side.  Both handles are stamped “stainless.”  The imperial handle is also marked with a sword-and-shield logo and “GERBER Multiplier” stamped on the side.<br>
    The imperial handle contains five-fold-out tools and the metric handle contains four-fold-out tools.  All of the tool’s lock in the open position by two sliding spring-loaded locks, one on each handle. In order to close a locked tool, you must push the sliding plastic switch against the spring to disengage the lock while simultaneously closing the tool.  I have had no trouble with the plastic lock switches and they have worked as advertised.<br>
    Looking at the five-fold-out tools within the imperial handle we find a two-and-one-eighth inch straight knife blade, small medium and large flat head screwdrivers, and a three- and one-half inch file. The medium flat head screw driver also includes a bottle opener.  The metric handle contains four-fold-out tools.  One two-and-a-half-inch serrated knife blade, a lanyard loop, a Phillips head screwdriver, and a can opener.<br>
    The multipliers came with a black nylon sheath that secures the multiplier with a flap secured with Velcro.   Clip & Carry sells a Kydex sheath for $29.99 that looks interesting.  The web site is <a href="https://www.clipandcarry.us/products/kydex-sheath-for-the-gerber-mp600">https://www.clipandcarry.us/products/kydex-sheath-for-the-gerber-mp600</a>.<br>
    Overall, I think the Gerber is a solid everyday-carry multiplier.  I haven’t had any malfunctions or noticed any damage to mine.  I’m not sure what the practical use of the lanyard loop is but I suppose you could use it as a plum bob:)<br>
