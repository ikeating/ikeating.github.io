        <h1>iBlog</h1>

        <h2>11/17/2024</h2>
        <p><br>

I’ve had quite a vacation from writing, last blog post was back in 2/14/2024, Valentine’s Day to be exact.  Since then, I’ve done a little brainstorm writing regarding personal interests, created a GRHS Marching Band blog page for Andrew, travel blog, but nothing updating what I’ve been up to.  What I have accomplished is getting my iBlog page off the ground and published! My goal going forward is to do a weekly update.  Trying to write daily burns me out and I lose interest.  Here's a few notes from the past few months;<br><br>

On 06/22/2024 we drove up to the Dimond S Ranch and attended the Sandstrom/Anderson Family Reunion.  The food was catered by Chad’s Meat Wagon.  A snapping turtle in the middle of David’s bridge attempted to prevent us from leaving early but we succeeded in sneaking by.<br><br>

A lot has changed for me employment wise.  On 07/19/2024, while working for the US Corps of Engineers at Winnie, I received a job offer from L&M as a forklift operator, and I received, and accepted, a job offer from Miner’s Inc. for Loss Prevention Specialist.  The following Monday I had to resign from the Corps, bus garage, and had to call L&M to turn down their offer.<br><br>

 On 07/28/2024, I went to the Foo Fighters concert at Target Field with Jamie, Mazie, Max Lundeen, Hector Fernandez, and one other relative of Jamie’s.  It was loud, rained on and off, the folding chairs were zip-tied together, lots of marijuana smoke, but it was still a great time.  Dave Grohl mentioned how he had been influenced by the band Husker Du out of Minneapolis.<br><br>

My first day of work for Miner’s was on 08/05/2024.  Over the past couple of months, I have traveled quite a bit to Duluth and Hibbing for training.  Working at the Duluth Plaza location has been interesting to say the least.<br><br>

I turned 50 on 10/10/2024. After work, I was greeted by Melanie and Dan.  Melanie gave Tiff and I a shot of Shanky’s and then gave me a 12 pack of Miller Lite.  Dan gave me some delicious Siracha beef sticks from Tykes.  Megan and Kassie then came over and we watched the Seahawks get defeated at home by the 49’s 36-24. Megan made me a cake that had a park ranger hat on it:)  Jamie also called me and wished me a happy birthday.<br><br>

Over MEA break we visited Seattle from October 16th through the 20th.  Please see my travel blog for details. <strong>Our<a href="seattle2024"> Seattle 2024</a> Trip </strong><br><br><br><br>

It was deer hunting opener on Saturday November the 9th so of course Tiffany, Andrew, and Grandma had to do their annual bazaar around Grand Rapids.  When they got back, Andrew said he wasn’t a big fan of a bazaar:)  I had a three-day weekend over the opener so I raked leaves, arranged for the snow blower to be serviced, and did other miscellaneous yard work.<br><br>

Moving into this past week, it has been Tech week (Frozen) for Andrew so he has been busy.  It was also conference week, we attended conferences on Monday, and then Andrew had Thursday and Friday off from school.  Tiff brought home Chinees take out and we watched the movie Independence Day starring Will Smith on Saturday.  Tonight, it was leftovers and the movie ‘A quiet Place: Day One’.  Andrew has been getting into more thriller/horror movies lately:)<br><br>
