01/13/2025 to 01/19/2025 Weekly<br><br>

Monday morning it was -16 degrees, welcome to January.  ü•∂  On Monday evening, Andrew had his <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FVSAi5ux6CkmZskUaJMNj3vhQJi3-iMUCHm46t2bcAo/edit">Symphonic Band Concert</a> .  They played Burn by Roland Barrett, October by Eric Whitacre, and Synergy Rising by Ryan Nowlin.<br><br>

After work on Tuesday, I attended a dive team meeting.  We are planning an ice dive on February 1st if it‚Äôs not to awful outside.<br><br>

Thursday January 16th, was the ninth anniversary of meeting my brother, Jamie Thingelstad, in New Ulm for the first time!  In order to commemorate the event, I traveled back in time and <a href="01_16_2016">created a blog post for the day ‚Äì 01/16/2016 daily</a>.  It was easy to do because I remember the day like it was yesterday.<br><br>

Andrew and Tiffany stated their New Year‚Äôs resolution is to stretch on a regular basis üôÜ‚Äç    With my resolution to read more books, everyone in the Keating household now has a resolution for the year.<br><br>

On Saturday morning, I completed the annual <a href="https://diverescueintl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IADRS_Watermanship_Test_Fillable.pdf">IADRS Watermanship Test</a> at the Robert J. Elkington Middle School Swimming Pool for the Itasca County Sheriff‚Äôs Department Dive Team.  I had been anxious about this for some time. Turning fifty, gaining seventeen pounds over the past year, and reflecting on poor past performance had led to a lot of negative thinking. However, I took two steps to improve my performance this year. First, I‚Äôve abstained from alcohol since December 27th. Second, I spent time researching how to properly perform the freestyle stroke.  I completed the 500-yard swim in 18:16 minutes, my best time so far. üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<br><br>

For the 800-yard snorkel swim, I again had trouble with my stiff plastic fins that I‚Äôve had for way to long.  Bill let me try his yellow Scuba pro twin jet snorkeling fins and they were so much more comfortable and allowed for a full kick.<br><br>

On Saturday night, we watched two movies, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Quiet_Place">A Quiet Place</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Quiet_Place_Part_II">A Quiet Place II</a>.  I mentioned the Quiet Place genre in my <a href="12_15_2024">12/15/2024 weekly</a>.  We liked all three but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Quiet_Place:_Day_One">A Quiet Place: Day One</a> seems to be our favorite.<br><br>

Sunday, I scheduled myself to work so I could have an upcoming three day weekend, it was just as well as it was -22 degrees this morning.
