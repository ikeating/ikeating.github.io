        <h2>Travel Day 0 - 10/15/2024</h2>
        
        <p>After Andrew was done with school, and Tiffany and I concluded work for the day, we left for Minneapolis for our anticipated early morning flight.  Tiffany had already brought Willow to the dog lodge the day prior.  We normally take Hwy 169 but due to construction we opted for the Floodwood, Moose Lake, Interstate 34, route instead.<p>

        <p>While traveling, we noticed the moon was almost full.  After checking, the moon will be full on Thursday the 17th.  Hopefully that’s a sign of good things to come:)<p>

        <p>After stopping in Moose Lake for a break, Andrew stated he wanted to drive for a bit.  Andrew haven’t driven on an interstate before.  He drove for a bit and as it started to get dark out, he said he had enough.<p>

        <p>We stopped in Forest Lake and ate dinner at Latin American restaurant called <a href="https://www.zoukmaya.com">Zoukmaya</a>.  Andrew had beef tacos, Tiffany had a combo plate, and I had a beef chimichanga.  We all loved our food and the ambiance was enjoyable.  The inside had a lot of tree roots covering the walls and ceiling and lighting that followed the edges of pillars.<p>

        <p>We then continued to our park & fly hotel located in Bloomington.  We stayed at the Holiday Inn and Express.  We all took showers and quickly went to bed.<p>

        <h2>Seattle Day 1 - 10/16/2024</h2>
        <p>We woke up at 4:30 am and got ready for our flight. After taking the hotel shuttle to Terminal one, we found our way to gate F11...</p>

        <h2>Seattle Day 2</h2>
        <p>Tiff and Andrew woke up at 5:30 am, and I didn’t get up until 7 am. We went to Seattle Center and toured the grounds...</p>

        <h2>Seattle Day 3</h2>
        <p>We started the day by attempting to do some last-minute planning. Adjusting to a moving timeline during a trip can be stressful...</p>

        <h2>Seattle Day 4</h2>
        <p>After getting ready for the day, we left at approximately 10:30 and walked to the Museum Of Pop Culture...</p>

        <h2>Travel Day 5</h2>
        <p>We woke up at 5 am Pacific time, finished packing, grabbed a quick complimentary breakfast, and called for a Lyft to the airport...</p>
