        <h2>Travel Day 0 - 10/15/2024</h2>
        
        <p>After Andrew was done with school, and Tiffany and I concluded work for the day, we left for Minneapolis for our anticipated early morning flight.  Tiffany had already brought Willow to the dog lodge the day prior.  We normally take Hwy 169 but due to construction we opted for the Floodwood, Moose Lake, Interstate 34, route instead.<p>

        <p>While traveling, we noticed the moon was almost full.  After checking, the moon will be full on Thursday the 17th.  Hopefully that’s a sign of good things to come:)<p>

        <p>After stopping in Moose Lake for a break, Andrew stated he wanted to drive for a bit.  Andrew haven’t driven on an interstate before.  He drove for a bit and as it started to get dark out, he said he had enough.<p>

        <p>We stopped in Forest Lake and ate dinner at Latin American restaurant called <a href="https://www.zoukmaya.com">Zoukmaya</a>.  Andrew had beef tacos, Tiffany had a combo plate, and I had a beef chimichanga.  We all loved our food and the ambiance was enjoyable.  The inside had a lot of tree roots covering the walls and ceiling and lighting that followed the edges of pillars.<p>

        <p>We then continued to our park & fly hotel located in Bloomington.  We stayed at the Holiday Inn and Express.  We all took showers and quickly went to bed.<p>

        <h2>Seattle Day 1 - 10/16/2024</h2>

        <p>We woke up at 4:30 am and got ready for our flight.  After taking the hotel shuttle to Terminal one, we found our way to gate F11.  Before boarding our plane, we ate breakfast at Hi-Lo Diner.  Andrew had pancakes, Tiffany had a breakfast burrito, and I had the Fodero-two eggs over easy-toast-bacon.</p>

        <p>The plane we are flying in is a Boeing 737-900ER.  It travels at a speed of 525 mph and has a range of 2,870 miles.  I am currently sitting in seat 17E flying over Wyoming as I write this!  More to come.<p>

        <p>We arrived at SeaTac and headed to the Link light rail station.  As we were walking to the station, Andrew found out he was selected to be second chair in the Grand Rapids High School Symphonic Band!  What a great start to our vacation! Tiff and I were able to obtain Orca cards and paired them with the Orca app.  I forgot we needed to actually use the cards and we accidentally boarded the train without swiping the cards before boarding.  Whoops, Tiff then had to purchase tickets through the Transit Go app after a friendly reminder:) After arriving at West Lake station, we transferred to the Monorail, and then walked a few blocks to the Hampton Inn and suites.<p>

        <p>After getting settled into room 352, Tiff and I walked over to Plaid Pantry convenience store and picked up a few items for our stay.  I purchased a 12 pack of Rainier Beer, when in Rome...  We then left to explore Pikes Place Market.  The weather was a lot better than we had anticipated, partly cloudy, warm, and a light wind.  We walked west down Pine Street and then turned south on Post Alley where we discovered Pike Place Chowder.  We had a sample of chowder with sourdough bread!  I definitely want to go back and have chowder in the sourdough bread bowl.<p>
 
        <p>We then headed into the market.  We witnessed the throwing of fish had lots of salmon samples, and discovered a cool community garden area that has a great view of the bay.  Lots of colors throughout the market, flowers, fruit, and seafood displays.  We stepped out of the market and took a group selfie in front of the oldest remaining Starbucks. We then stopped at Hellenika Cultured Creamery and I tried the London Fog, it was delicious!  We then made our way down to the piers to get tickets for the Great Wheel.<p>

        <p>The Seattle Great Wheel located on Pier 57 is the largest Farris wheel on the west coast!  We all had a blast and the views were amazing!  I love it when a tourist attraction brings out the kid in you:)<p>

        <h2>Seattle Day 2</h2>
        <p>Tiff and Andrew woke up at 5:30 am, and I didn’t get up until 7 am. We went to Seattle Center and toured the grounds...</p>

        <h2>Seattle Day 3</h2>
        <p>We started the day by attempting to do some last-minute planning. Adjusting to a moving timeline during a trip can be stressful...</p>

        <h2>Seattle Day 4</h2>
        <p>After getting ready for the day, we left at approximately 10:30 and walked to the Museum Of Pop Culture...</p>

        <h2>Travel Day 5</h2>
        <p>We woke up at 5 am Pacific time, finished packing, grabbed a quick complimentary breakfast, and called for a Lyft to the airport...</p>
