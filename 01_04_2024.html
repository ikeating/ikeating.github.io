        <p>04/01/2024 Adventures</p>

    <p>I thought today I would briefly note some great adventures I’ve had.  What words define a great adventure?  Memorable, comradeship, out-side-the-box, unknown, mental/physical effort, danger, unknown risk, excitement, doubt, and financial risk are all word(s) that encompass traits of a great adventure to me. Let’s begin!</p>
