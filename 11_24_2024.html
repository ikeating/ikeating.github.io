This past week was fairly uneventful for me.  Andrew was busy with theaterüé≠ rehearsal throughout the week in preparation for opening night of <a href="https://www.mtishows.com/disneys-frozen-jr">Frozen</a> on Friday.  Other than work, I spent the week re-watching some episodes of The Fringe on Prime.  Tiffany had to update our utility accounts with new payment information because we received new Capital One Cards with an updated expiration date.  This seemed a bit ridiculous to me as most companies automatically take care of this now. <br><br>
 
On 11/20/2024, we received our first trace of snow‚ùÑÔ∏è that stayed on the ground throughout the day.  The following day, 11/21, felt cold... Winters coming.  Work was a bit of a cluster on the 22nd, two lost cell phones led to an unnecessary amount of work and confusion. <br><br>
 
On Saturday, Tammy arrived and we headed over to Deb‚Äôs for a tour of her place before going out to eat at <a href="https://www.rapidsbrewingco.com">Rapids Brewing</a>.  While eating, we listened to <a href="https://paullawrence.net"> Paul Lawrence</a> sing and play acoustical guitar.  We then dropped Deb off at her home and then headed to the <a href="https://www.reifcenter.org">Reif</a> for Frozen. <br><br>
 
I was super proud of Andrew‚Äôs developing acting and singing ability.  He is growing so fast.  He also had a scene that he sang and played the Ukulele that was amazing.  So proud of him!  Riely also knocked everyone's socks off with her version of Let It Go.  Her fast-dress-change during the middle of the song generated a huge round of applause from the audience. <br><br>
 
Sunday morning, we went to <a href="https://www.nopokitchen.com">NoPo Kitchen</a> for breakfast.  It's been a while since we have had breakfast at NoPo but had heard the food has improved so we wanted to try it.  I tried the Everything Omelet with a side of bacon and hashbrowns. I also decided to splurge and had a cup of Peruvian drip coffee‚òï.  The omelet, bacon, and coffee were delicious, the hashbrowns were good but not as fluffy as I would like.  I also had a second cup of coffee that I would later regret having.  The effects of having too much coffee were unpleasant for a couple of hours.  I felt symptoms similar to a bout of anxiety, dizziness, edginess, and overall feeling of uncomfortableness.  One cup of coffee going forward.  Tiffany, Tammy, and Andrew also thought their food was excellent!  We will definitely be going back for breakfast in the future. <br><br>
 
While were eating, Tammy had mentioned a snake that she was concerned with because Mazie is going on a trip to Costa Rica.  Turns out, I also had read about this snake in the book <a href="https://www.prestonchild.com/books/preston/monkeygod/">Lost City of the Monkey God</a>.  Tammy noticed this and said she also has this book.  The snake is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bothrops_asper">Fer-de-lance</a>üêç.  I think Mazie will be just fine as long as she sticks to known paths. <br><br>
 
Tammy had to head back home, Andrew left to perform the final act of Frozen, and Tiffany also later left to watch the final act with my uncle Pat, Deb, Steve, and Julie.  Tiffany then went out to eat with Deb, Steve, Pat, and Kim at the Forest Lake restaurant.  Andrew stayed back with his fellow cast members to help take down the set and later have super at Culver‚Äôs.  I had to work an evening shift for Miner‚Äôs.  Pat stopped by work and we were able to talk for a bit before he headed back to his hotel.
