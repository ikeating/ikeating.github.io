12/23/2024 to 12/29/2024 Christmas WeeklyüéÑ <br><br>
  
On Christmas Eve morning, all of the trees were covered in either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rime_ice">Rime ice</a> or <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/hoarfrost">Hoarfrost</a> due to fog that had frozen to the trees during the previous night‚ùÑÔ∏è.  It made for a beautiful view as I crossed the causeway on my way to work.  After work, I went to Deb‚Äôs and met Tiffany, Andrew, Steve, Julie, and David for Christmas Eve hors-d‚Äôoeuvres. Deb prepared ham balls, made her famous potato salad, marinated Gulf shrimpüç§ with lots of horseradish, brisket, and many other snacks for us.  After returning home, we opened presents and enjoyed the rest of the evening before bed. <br><br>
  
Christmas day, we had Deb, Steve, and Kim over for dinner.  Tiffany made 5.33 lbs. of prime rib.  She preheated the oven to 500 degrees, cooked the prime rib for 30 minutes, shut the oven off and let sit for two hours, and then removed and let rest for twenty minutes. For every pound, she cooks for five minutes. Tiffany gets the Prime Cut, rather than the Choice Cut at S&S Meats, it's a bit more expensive but worth it. ü•© It turned out absolutely mouthwatering! <br><br>
 
Kim gifted a <a href="https://artandlutherieguitars.com">Art & Lutherie Folk Cedar CW guitar</a> to Andrew for Christmas.  It was handmade in LaPatrie & Princeville, Qu√©bec, Canada by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godin_(guitar_manufacturer)">Godin</a>.  He has been taking a classical guitar class this last semester so we are already enjoying listening to him play. <br><br>
 
And last but not least, Willow was born on 12/25/2020 so it was her fourth birthday!  Hopefully she stays overly excited for years to come. <br><br>
 
On Saturday the 28th, we took an unplanned day trip to Duluth.  We first stopped at <a href="https://crumblcookies.com/">Crumbl Cookies üç™</a>, Andrews current favorite cookie stop.  We selected some Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chunk cookies and one Salted Caramel Pretzel Pie. We then made our way to the <a href="https://duluthgrill.com">Duluth Grill</a> for brunch.  I enjoyed a rare cup of coffee and had the Everything Skillet with over easy eggs.  The Hollandaise sauce was thick and firm, it remined me of sauce I‚Äôve had on a filet mignon.  After asking the waitress about the sauce, she said to just get some <a href="https://www.knorr.com/us/en/p/hollandaise.html/00048001703056">Knorr Hollandaise Mix</a>.  Next time I‚Äôm in Chicago, I need to get a skillet breakfast from <a href="https://wildberrycafe.com/locations/chicago-prudential-plaza">Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe</a> to compare. <br><br>
 
After brunch, we headed over to the <a href="https://www.zenithbookstore.com">Zenith Book Store</a>.  It's become a bit of a tradition for us to combine visiting the Duluth Grill with the bookstore, if only because they're so close together.  I picked up a paperback copy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alive:_The_Story_of_the_Andes_Survivors">Alive, The Story of the Andes Survivors</a>.  I‚Äôm familiar with the story, but I thought I'd read the book.  After Andrew and I made our purchases, we then drove to the Duluth Trading Company.  After looking around, we walked up and down E Superior St to see how the shops were doing.  We came across a cool independent movie theater called <a href="https://zeitgeistarts.com/zinema2/">Zinema</a>.  I‚Äôm not up on independent films but would be cool to see one sometime. <br><br>
 
Before dinner, we drove to the Miller Hill Mall to do some additional shopping.  We were lucky to find a good parking space as the mall was very busy.  I feel like people would still rather go to a physical store to try on, and shop for clothes rather than buy online, but I could be wrong. <br><br>
 
We then went to Canal Park and stopped at <a href="https://www.bellisios.com">Bellisio‚Äôs Italian Restaurant and Wine Bar</a> for dinner.  We all shared a Tuscan Salad and Bellisio‚Äôs Bread Basket, I then ordered Lobscargotü¶ûfor my main course, Tiffany had Pappardelle alla Norcina, and Andrew had Fettuccine Alfredo. <br><br>
 
That about wraps up a wonderful Christmas week, now on to New Year‚Äôs activities and celebrations!
