        <p>01/02/2024 2023 Holiday Recap</p>

        <p>As usual the holidays past by in a blink of an eye, but everyone seemed to have a great time and there was only a couple of hiccups along the way.  To start the holidays, I was summoned for jury duty for December and January.  I ended up having to report for jury duty on December 6th and 13th.  On both occasions I thankfully wasn’t selected for the jury.  However, I suspect I picked a nasty cold from being in a small room with all the jurors and ended up being sick from December 8th through the 10th.</p>
        <p>I was supposed to go with Tiffany and Andrew on December 9th to see Aladdin with the Thingelstad’s but was not able due to my cold.  However, they went and had a great weekend full of holiday activities.</p>
        <p>By December 15th I had recovered and was able to have a holiday get-together at Florio’s with Tiff, Andrew, Deb, Vernon and his friend Kate.  The following day, December 16th, Tiffany, Andrew, and I attended the Rock and Roll Christmas Spectacular at the Reif.  This has become a tradition for us and never disappoints.</p>
        <p>The Transportation Department had a holiday potluck at the bus garage on December 21st.  The food was wonderful and I had a really good time visiting with fellow bus drivers.  It was especially sweet for me as I have recently obtained a new bus route that I like.  I previously had bus route 38 and now have 34.</p>
        <p>I made an attempt to put forth a serious effort at ice fishing during the holiday break.  I went to the Pokegama Lake store and purchased a scoop of Fat Head Minnows and a dozen Shiners.  I also went up into the garage attic and retrieved all the necessary hardware and made sure it was working.  Then…the weather decided it wasn’t winter anymore.  At first the ice was a good 7 inches but as the break wore on, it was reduced done to 4 to 5 inches.  We also got a lot of rain which didn’t help.  I gave it a good try in front of my place but was only able to catch one perch.  I have future plans of heading across to Sandbar point.</p>
        <p>We went to Deb’s for Christmas Eve and visited with Julie.  On Christmas Day we had Deb and Kim over for celebration and dinner.  Tiffany made a Prim Rib which was absolutely to die for!  She has done this three times so far and each one has turned out perfect.</p>
        <p>Andrew was excited to receive a new Nintendo Switch, Beats ear buds, and a new desk.  On a somewhat humorous note, Tiffany bought us lottery tickets…which is also what I had bought Tiffany.  Andrew won a few bucks but Tiffany and I didn’t do well:)  I think we agreed that idea may stay in 2023.</p>
        <p>The dive team was paged on December 28th to prepare for a possible recovery in the Northwest Angle on Lake of the Woods.  A Bombardier track vehicle and gone through the ice by Flag Island.  There was one victim but personnel on scene were able to make the recovery which turned out to be very fortunate for me as I once again got a chest infection.  I ended up being sick from December 28th to January 2nd.  I also had a filling put in on the 28th which then fell out on January 2nd:)</p>
        <p>Lastly, we had dinner at the Timberlake lodge with Deb and her friend Steve to celebrate New Year’s Eve.  After, we watched the ball drop at home with Dick Clark’s Special.  All in all, it was a great holiday break and it went by supper fast.</p>
