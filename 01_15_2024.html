        <p>01/15/2024 Weekend review<br><br>

    Andrew and I had a nice three-day weekend due to no school on Monday.  Tiffany had to work on Monday but she also had a great time.<br>
    Andrew had theater practice for his role as Grimsby in The Little Mermaid on Friday afternoon.  Tiffany and Andrew then went to El Potro for takeout.  I had a ground beef Chimichanga that was delicious. After super we watched Leave The World Behind.  I thought it was a great movie, kind of had vibes similar to Cape Fear.  I probably would need to watch it again to get its full meaning but it was about hackers infiltrating our world and causing people to turn against each other causing chaos and destruction.<br>
    On Saturday, Tiffany made Porchetta for dinner.  Tiffany and Andrew then went to the movie Wonka and I stayed home to prepare for guests on Sunday.<br>
    Sunday was cold, it was around -11!  After getting ready for the day, I hauled out the Clam ice fishing house and began attempting to set it up.  I got it out of its bag, expanded the pull-out sides and top.  I then entered it and marked four spots where I would auger fishing holes.  I then pulled the Clam off the spot and then augured the holes.  While I was ice auguring, I had my back to the Clam.  After I was done, I turned around and realized the Clam was gone…. It blew all the way to Melanie’s.  After sprinting after my ice house, I eventually got everything set up for fishing.  It was quite the hassle and of course Tiffany watched the whole fiasco:)<br>
    After getting everything set up, Megan, Kassi, and Maple showed up to do a little ice fishing and then we all watched the Green Bay Packers vs the Dallas Cowboys football playoff game.  We didn’t do very well fishing but Megan caught a Perch and the Green Bay Packers, to Megan’s delight, beat the Cowboys.  Megan had brought some Honey Whiskey with her and we had a taste.  It reminded me of Fire Ball but without the cinnamon and not as sugary.  I grilled polish and bratwurst, Tiffany made a Greek pasta salad, and Megan brought taco dip.  We all had a really nice time visiting and Willow had fun playing with Maple.  After everyone left, I went back out to try fishing again.  It was frigid out.  It was spooky being in the dark and hearing the ice cracking all around.  I didn’t get anything and after a short time returned home.<br>
    I slept in on Monday.  After getting ready for the day, I returned to the Clam to try fishing again.  Sunday night I had just left the Clam out on the lake due to how cold it was and the Clam was frozen into the ice.  At around 5pm Andrew walked out with Willow to say hi.  Andrew must have brought me good luck because after they left, I had a really big fish on but lost him.  At 5:30 I caught a nice thirteen-inch Walleye!  What a great way to wrap up the long weekend.<br>
