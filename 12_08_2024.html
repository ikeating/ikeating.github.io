        12/02/2024 to 12/08/2024 Weekly<br><br>

        Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, were fairly quiet work days.  Tuesday, we received some snow and later in the evening, I attended a dive team meeting.  Before the meeting we got to examine the sheriff departments new <a href="https://sherpusadealer.com">Sherp</a>.  I hope I get a chance to dive out of it somedayü§û.  Sherps are manufactured in the Ukraine and shipped back to the US in shipping containers.  After the meeting, I had dinner with Rich, Andrea, Jon, and Thomas at the Forest Lake Bar.  Wednesday, I witnessed a couple of trucks sliding off the highway due to wind and a slippery roadway while driving to Deer River for work.<br><br>

        Thursday morning before work, I went to Grand Itasca Medical Clinic for my annual physical with Doctor Keith Patrick Murphy.  I received my COVID, Flu, and Shingles vaccinations.  I then provided blood for a blood workup.  After my results were in, Doctor Murphy noted the following in MyChart, ‚ÄúLiver testing is elevated again.  This is likely due to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.  The treatment is to lose weight.  If left unchecked can lead to cirrhosis and death.‚Äù<br><br>

        After my physical, I had an hour before I had to go to work, so I stopped at Dunkin for breakfast.  I had a Sourdough breakfast sandwich, six hashbrowns, and a delicious cup of hot black coffee.  This is the first time I have visited the Grand Rapids Dunkin and I thought it was nice.<br><br>

        After work, I picked up three seasoned Chuck eye steaks from S&S meats for dinner.  My manager from work had informed me that Chuck eyes are the bottom part of a Ribeye.  They turned out tender, juicy, and full of taste.  After dinner, I unfortunately didn‚Äôt escape the aftereffects of the three vaccinations I had received earlier in the morning.  Every time I have received a COVID shot, my arms get sore, my muscles stiffen up, I get hot and cold, and I get extremely tiredü§í.<br><br>

        On Friday evening, we attended the Grand Rapids High School A Cappella Choir‚Äôs 29th annual Madrigal Dinner theater at Zion Lutheran Church.  This year‚Äôs performance was titled ‚ÄúRapunzel Rapunzel, Let Down Your Heir.‚Äù  The event was directed by Jacob Hanson, Anja Beck was the narrating jester, and Andrew played a young English boy. Madrigal is a song genre from the renaissance era. Upon arrival, we were given hot cups of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wassail">Wassail</a> and then seated at table four.  We were immersed into medieval England and joined the king for dinner and entertainment complete with a Boars Headüêó centerpiece.  NoPo catered the dinner which consisted of a chicken thigh, root vegetable, and garlic mashed potatoes.  After dinner we were treated to Christmas carols from the choir.<br><br>

        Ice-in on Wendigo occurred on Friday 12/06/2024, I think.  I find it hard to nail down ice-in because it could open back up again and then ice-in later.  I guess we could call it the ‚ÄúFirst Ice-In.‚Äù  First ice-in last year was on 11/29/2023 and the year before was on 11/22/2022.  I might also note that ice-out this year was on 03/20/2024 and last year it was more than a month later on 05/04/2023.  Sorry about the terrible visualization of data, I‚Äôll have to make a graph sometime.<br><br>

        Saturday, Tiffany volunteered to help out in the kitchen at Zion for the last day of Madrigal.  Andrew also was performing for the last performance so I was left to fend for myself.  I decided to grill myself a Ribeye, baked a potato, and had green onions on the side.  After dinner, I watched the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien:_Romulus">Alien Romulus</a>.  Coincidently, I noticed the movie had several <a href="https://sherputv.com/sherp-vehicles-in-the-movie-alien-romulus/">Sherp UTVs</a> in it, the same Sherp the sheriff‚Äôs office just obtained!  I thought it was good but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus_(2012_film)">Prometheus</a> is still my favorite within the Alien Franchise.<br><br>

        Sunday was quiet, we took care of chores and got ready for the upcoming work week.  It snowed big clumpy snowflakes on and off thought the day. ‚ùÑÔ∏è Tiffany made some delicious lasagna for dinner.
