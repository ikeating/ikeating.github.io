        <h2>01/01/2024</h2>
        <p>Star Date 01/01/2024
        Julian day 2460311.08333
        Unix Time 170439764</p>
        <p>It’s the first day of 2024 and for a while I was having trouble thinking of a good New Years resolution.  Tiffany’s resolution is to de-clutter and Andrew said he has a lot but will “get back to me on that:)” A few weeks ago, I read an interview my brother Jamie, who is a blogger, gave to a fellow blogger.  Jamie said that a good way to start writing is to just write about anything and don’t get hung up on what to write.  I’ve wanted to write some sort of a blog/journal for some time but haven’t committed to it.  After pondering Jamie’s advice and wanting to have a resolution for the year the lightbulb came on.  My new year’s resolution is to write everyday about…well…anything.</p>
        <p>My first priority is to not lock myself into what this has to be.  I don’t want to call this a blog nor do I want this to be a journal.  Giving this any type of label could possibly stifle writing so I’ll steer clear of labeling for now. I’m also not going to put any size limit on it other than I do need to write something.</p>
        <p>Next order of business is to establish what method I would like to timestamp my writing.  First thought is to use the day/month/year format.  My space nerd self wants to use the Julian system.  Nasa has an easy date/time conversion at <a href="https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/tools/jdc/#/cd33">https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/tools/jdc/#/cd33</a>.  Also thought it would be cool to use Unix time.  Unix time is the number of seconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 UTC on 01/01/1970.  A good time/date converter can be found at <a href="https://www.epochconverter.com">https://www.epochconverter.com</a>.  I don’t want to violate my first priority so I’ve decided I can use whatever method I feel like on any given day.  Today I’ve used all three and I might use something entirely different in the future.</p>
        <p>The last thought is what am I going to use to write with and how am I going to save/store it.  Physically writing in a journal would discourage me from writing due to my bad penmanship and poor spelling.  I am the most comfortable with using Microsoft Word so for now I will primarily use that.  I may write in the future using Raspberry Pi OS, LibreOffice.  As for saving/storing my writing, I probably will just save them locally for now.  I have a Tumblr account at <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/ikeating">https://www.tumblr.com/ikeating</a> that I call iBlog but it never stimulated me to write in it.  I may decide to push them to my GitHub page <a href="https://ikeating.github.io">https://ikeating.github.io</a> in the future.  Some things to ponder in the future;</p>
        <p> •   who is my audience
            •   what font do I like the best
            •   whether or not to publish someplace</p>
        <p>So that’s my setup for my new year’s resolution.  It will be fun to see how it motivates and helps me with other ideas, plans, and goals.  If anyone is reading this, have a great New Year’s!</p>
        
        <p>End of blog. Thank you for reading!</p>
