01/06/2025 to 01/12/2025 Weekly Update<br><br>

Monday night, Katie E. Smith, Artistic Programs Director for the <a href="https://www.reifcenter.org/">Reif Center</a>, released the cast list for <a href="https://www.reifcenter.org/event/reif-theater-arts-presents-disneys-newsies-jr/">Newsies Jr</a> .üóûÔ∏è and Andrew was selected to play the part of Albert.  He is very happy with his role; castings are always very stressful! üé≠<br><br>

On Wednesday, Andrew had Drum Major tryouts for the Grand Rapids Marching Band in front of Dale Gunderson, Sander Grotjohn, and one current & two graduating, Drum Majors.  We found out on Thursday that Andrew was selected!  He will be traveling to University of Colorado, Boulder July 8th through the 11th to attend <a href="https://drummajor.org/workshops/cu">George N. Parks Drum Major Academy</a>.  When I had attended my first Fill the Hill, I had thought how cool it would be if Andrew made Drum Major - and here we are today! So proud of him and what a fantastic opportunity.  For the 2025 GRMB season, Aaron (Junior), Joslin (Sophomore), and Andrew (Junior) will be the Drum Majors.<br><br>

Saturday Kim had her dog Willy pull her down Wendigo arm on her <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kicksled">kicksled</a> to our house to say hi üëã.  It was approximately 12 degrees out but she was dressed right and seemed comfortable. <br><br>

Saturday afternoon, I finished reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletons_on_the_Zahara">Skeletons On The Zahara</a>, Dean Kingüê™.  There were two ideas that stood out while reading the book, communal sharing of food and drink to support nomadic living, and negotiation and bartering for preservation of relationships.  I also got strong Dune vibes from the book.  I will probably never visit Western Sahara, but after reading this book, I almost feel like I‚Äôve been there.  After finishing the book, I decided that my 2025 New Year‚Äôs resolution will be to read more books. üìñ <br><br>

Saturday evening, Tiffany made Snow Crab for dinner; they were very good. ü¶Ä. We like King Crab the best but they haven‚Äôt been affordable for quite some time.  I miss the days of going to the Nine Mile Bar for all you can eat King Crab!  There is a litany of reasons why King Crab is so expensive and this article, <a href="https://homediningkitchen.com/why-are-alaskan-king-crab-legs-so-expensive-this-year/">The Great Alaska King Crab Conundrum: Why Prices Are Skyrocketing This Year by Leon Martinez</a>, pretty much sums it up.<br><br>

Saturday night/Sunday morning we finally got 5 to 6 inches of snow.  Long overdue and not nearly enough yet.  Sunday morning was actually the first time I used my snow blower, I was very thankful I had it serviced this last fall.
