        <h2>04/22/2021</h2>
        <p>Very sunny and warm today, reached approximately 60 degrees. The Mars Ingenuity helicopter successfully made it’s second flight today. Very interesting to see a drone fly on another planet. Relocated black dirt that had been plowed/eroded off of our septic area. Raked everything smooth and planted grass seed.....</p>

        <p>For some time now I have been trying to get together an effective study plan for Java/ IntelliJ. Haven’t found the right path yet. My thoughts for success; creating better blocks of programming time, ya just spending more time with it. Also could mix it up with C++ as well.</p>

        <p>Thought about the idea of working with other people to create a group of like minded programming nerds. Would be fun to get together and share ideas and help each other with problems. Also may help with ideas for making money:). Just an idea and there may be a group around already.</p>
        
        <p>End of blog. Thank you for reading!</p>
