<h1>iKeating</h1>
<p>Welcome!  My name is Isaiah Keating and my family and I live just south of Grand Rapids, Minnesota in Harris Township.  Our home is located on the Wendigo arm of Pokegama Lake. After graduating high school in Grand Rapids, I obtained my AAS in law enforcement from Hibbing Community and Technical College.
I served as a Peace officer for twenty-four years, twenty of which for the City of Canby as Chief of Police.
During my employment with the City of Canby, I obtained an AA degree in Liberal Arts from Minnesota West Community College. I then attended Dakota State University.
After moving back to Grand Rapids, I applied for, and was accepted as a member of the Itasca County Sheriffâ€™s Department Volunteer Dive Team in 2021.
