	Welcome!  My name is Isaiah Keating.  My family and I live on Pokegama Lake just south of Grand Rapids, Minnesota in Harris Township.
<BR><BR/>
	After graduating high school in Grand Rapids, I earned my AAS degree in law enforcement from Hibbing Community and Technical College.  I served as a Peace officer for twenty-four years, twenty of which for the City of Canby as Chief of Police.
<BR><BR/>
	During my employment with the City of Canby, I earned my Associate of Arts degree in Liberal Arts (Phi Theta Kappa) from Minnesota West Community College. I then attended Dakota State University's computer science program.  While attending DSU, I completed the Computer Science I & II courses.
<BR><BR/>
	After moving back to Grand Rapids, I applied for, and was accepted as a member of the Itasca County Sheriffâ€™s Department Volunteer Dive Team in 2021.
