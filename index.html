	Welcome!  My name is Isaiah Keating and my family and I live just south of Grand Rapids,
	Minnesota in Harris Township.  Our home is located on the Wendigo arm of Pokegama Lake.

	After graduating high school in Grand Rapids, I earned my AAS degree in law enforcement
	from Hibbing Community and Technical College.  I served as a Peace officer for twenty-four
	years, twenty of which for the City of Canby as Chief of Police.

	During my employment with the City of Canby, I earned my Associate of Arts degree in Liberal
	Arts (Phi Theta Kappa) from Minnesota West Community College. I then attended Dakota State
	University's computer science program.  While attending DSU, I completed the Computer
	Science I & II courses but did not recieve a degree.

	After moving back to Grand Rapids, I applied for, and was accepted as a member of the
	Itasca County Sheriff’s Department Volunteer Dive Team in 2021.
