12/09/2024 to 12/15/2024 Weekly<br><br>

Monday and Tuesday were quiet, uneventful work days.  On Wednesday the 11th, I helped interviewed a new potential candidate for the dive team.  After returning home, Tiffany made me some chicken parmesan noodles for dinner.  It was very cold on Thursday the 12th, -10 when I left for work. Andrew is taking care of Julie’s dogs while she is in Las Vegas for a Ruffed Grouse event.  Due to the cold weather, we chose to have hot spaghetti 🍝 for dinner.<br><br>

Friday morning it was -17 degrees🥶.  My check engine light came on…brake sensor failure.  This actually didn’t surprise me too much, when it’s that cold I’m impressed any vehicle will work.  After work, Deb and Steve picked up Vernon and we had a holiday dinner at Florio’s Grill & Tavern.<br><br>

On Saturday the 14th, I spotted the first ice house of the season in front of our home.  I walked out onto the ice, poked a hole through the ice with my spud bar, and found there to be approximately 6 inches of ice. Fun fact, according to ChatGPT “The word “spud” is believed to have come from the Old Norse word “spjót,” meaning spear.”<br><br>

Andrew left for Anja’s to go to Snowball and a sleepover after.  Tiffany and I, were picked up by Ali and Shari Weber who drove us to Harry’s for dinner.  I ended up ordering a full rack of ribs that had just been removed from Harry’s smoker, they were outstanding!<br><br>

After we returned home, Tiffany and I watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10_Cloverfield_Lane">10 Cloverfield Lane</a>, the second film in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloverfield_(franchise)">Cloverfield franchise</a>.  I found it interesting that they were considering the film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Quiet_Place">A Quite Place</a> to be the fourth film in the Cloverfield series.<br><br>

Over the years, family members have mailed, or given us, tasty treats for the holidays.  This week, Pat Keating sent us a delicious honey baked ham🐖 from <a href="https://www.honeybaked.com/home">The Honey Baked Ham Company</a>.  Marlyn and Gordon also sent us treats from <a href="https://libertyorchards.com">Liberty Orchards</a> that included Choco Dragee 4-Flavor Fruit Assortment, the Dark Chocolate Pineapple🍍 Dragee Delight is my favorite, and some Aplets🍎 & Cotlets🍊, Tiffany likes the Cotlets the best.  Julie Sandstrom gave us some fruit and snacks from <a href="https://www.pittmandavis.com">Pittman & Davis</a> that included some of the best caramel corn🌽 that I have had in some time.<br><br>

For several years, Marlyn and Gordon used to send everyone a sealed can of Cougar Cheese🧀 from the https://creamery.wsu.edu/cougar-cheese/ Washington State University Creamery for the holidays.  I still have one can in my refrigerator that has been aging since 10/18/2018 and another from 11/16/2020.<br><br>

All weekend I have been listening to <a href="https://youtu.be/V1LhC1zGouc?si=4_DwiYw6ulT3qeA2">Lanie Gardner - Dreams by Fleetwood Mac (Cover)</a>, also available on <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/dreams-lanies-version-single/1708990858">Apple Music</a>.  Lanie’s voice is amazing, reminds me of a young Miley Cyrus.<br><br>

Sunday, Andrew returned home from Anja’s after attending Snowball.  Tiffany made a turkey in the crockpot, Grandma Blair’s Stuffing, real mashed potatoes, green beans, sweet potato pie, and of course cranberries.   After Dinner, we all went for a walk on the lake for the first time this year.  After returning, we got ready for the up-coming week and relaxed for the rest of the evening.
