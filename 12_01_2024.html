11/25/2024 to 12/01/2024 - Weekly<br><br>

Early Monday morning we picked up approximately two inches of snow to kick off the week.  It would turn out to be a cold week as well.  On Wednesday morning the 27th Steve brought over a lovely Balsam Fir Christmas tree that he harvested from his property.  Tiffany and Andrew got the tree mounted to the base Wednesday evening before I got off work.  After I got home, we made a Deluxe Combination Thin Crust <a href="https://heggiespizza.com">Heggies Pizza</a> .  I thought the thin crust was tasty and I liked the copious amount of gooey, thick Mozzarella cheese.  Also cool that they are made just south of us in Milaca, MN.  After dinner we watched the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_After_Tomorrow">The Day After Tomorrow</a> .  Andrew thought it was entertaining, Tiffany didn‚Äôt care for it, and I thought it was a bit dramatic.  I also watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppenheimer_(film)">Oppenheimer</a> after everyone had gone to bed.  It was good but long.  I feel like I need to rewatch it again to properly review it.<br><br>

On Thanksgiving morning, Thursday the 28th, we watched the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/macys-thanksgiving-day-parade-2024-how-watch-time-stream-channel-route-rcna180992">98th Macy‚Äôs Thanksgiving Day Parade</a> hosted by Savannah Guthrie, Hoda Kotb and Al Roker.  The Sioux Falls Lincoln HS Marching band, who hosted the Festival of Bands that Andrew competed in on 10/05/2024, was in the parade.<br><br>

For Thanksgiving dinner, Tiffany, Andrew, and I went to the <a href="https://timberlakelodgehotel.com/timberlake-restaurant/">Timberlake Restaurant</a> and met up with Debra, Steve, Julie, Alex, and David.  While eating dinner, I found out that Alex makes sourdough bread.  David mentioned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Baker_(ice_hockey,_born_1956)">Billy Baker</a>, Billy Dallas‚Äôs uncle, played in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_on_Ice">Miracle on Ice</a> for Team USA üèí.  Steve mentioned he is going to start trapping beavers, they are cutting down his treesü¶´.  The food was good and we all had fun visiting.  Julie had to leave early to go help Uncle Bobby who had been admitted to the hospital and needed to get back to assisted living.<br><br>

On Thanksgiving evening, we picked up Kim at our house, and then went to see the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_(2024_film)">Wicked</a> üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü™Ñ.  We went to, and loved, the Broadway musical Wicked on 08/22/2022 so we were very excited to see the film.  The opening scene of the announcement of the death of Elphaba was powerful.   Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande were perfect for their roles.  The transition of Elphaba turning against the Wizard during the soundtrack Defying Gravity was captivating.  After watching the movie, I was curious as to who The Witch of the North was and found the following.  The Good Witch of the North is Locasta or Tattypoo.  In the original book, Locasta meets Dorothy after her house falls on Elphaba‚Äôs sister, Nessarose, the Wicked Witch of the East.  Locasta gives Dorothy Nessarose‚Äôs silver(ruby) slippers and sends her on her way.  In the movie, The Wizard of Oz, Locasta character is combined with Glinda, Good Witch of the South.<br><br>

Throughout Thanksgiving Day, it continued to lightly snow.  It is nice to see snow and I hope we get lots of it this winter.  Also, curious when the lake will freeze over.  It‚Äôs been windy so that might be causing a delay with freeze over.<br><br>

On Friday the 29th, Tiffany, Andrew, and Deb went Black Friday shopping.  Tiffany received her Air Pods Pro in the mail.  She is impressed with them and hopefully she finds them comfortable.  After Tiffany and Andrew finished decorating the Christmas tree, I grilled a couple of Porter House steaks that Tiffany had picked up at S&S Meats.  After diner, I purchased the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix">The Matrix</a> off of iTunes.  My brother had recently watched The Matrix with his family so I thought there was a chance Tiffany and Andrew would enjoy it.  Tiffany left the room after approximately fifteen minutes and Andrew just fell asleep‚Ä¶<br><br>

On Saturday the 30th, we picked up Deb and went to  <a href="https://www.valentinissupperclub.com">Valentinis Supper Club</a> for dinner in Chisholm. We started off with an appetizer of Bacon Wrapped Scallops, mouthwatering.  For the main course, I had the Italian Combination Plate with a creamy vegetable soup that was fantastic. The white sauce was amazing and the chicken cacciatore was heavenly.  I tried two Martinis, the first üç∏ gin on the rocks with olive juice, and the second was vodka on the rocks with no olive juice.  As much as I want to be James Bond, I didn‚Äôt care for them.  Next time, I am going to order the Four Piece Chicken Cacciatore.<br><br>

Tiffany and Andrew carried on the annual holiday tradition of making Lefse on Sunday morning, 12/01/2024.  Tiffany uses a <a href="http://bethanyhousewares.com/lefse-grills/">Bethany Heritage Grill</a> to make her Lefse.  I had to return to work on Sunday evening ending the holiday week.
