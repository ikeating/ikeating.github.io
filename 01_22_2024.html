        <p>01/22/2024 Another three-day weekend<br><br>

        I had another three-day weekend due to end of semester.  Saturday morning, I met my fellow dive team members at the barn to replace regulator hose O-rings.  After which, we then headed to the middle school pool for our gear checkout and I.A.D.R.S. watermanship swim test.  The first test is a 500-yard swim which is 10 laps (20 times back and forth.)  I completed the test but was not happy with my performance.  The second test involves treading water for 15 minutes, your hands have to be out of the water the last two minutes of the test.  Treading water never has been an issue for me as I can pretty much float without moving.  The third test is the 800-yard (16 laps or 32 times back and forth) snorkel swim. Again, swimming with any speed is not my strong suite.  The fourth test is free diving to a depth of nine feet and retrieving an object.  I completed this test with no problem.  We didn’t do the 100-yard inert rescue tow.<br><br>
        Unfortunately, Andrew picked up RSV…? Maybe… and had to stay home from school on Friday, the last day of the semester.  He pretty much had to stay home the whole weekend.  He didn’t start feeling better until Monday when he was able to attend theater practice.<br><br>
        After the swim test on Saturday, Tiff and I, drove over to the Trout Lake Community Center for the annual SAR appreciation pot-luck.  It was fun to visit with people and the food was delicious.  After eating, we left and drove to the Bolder Taphouse to meet Kassi and Megan for cocktails and watch a bit of the Green Bay Packers vs. the San Francisco 49’s game.  We stayed until halftime and the we all went home.  Much to Megan’s displeasure, Green Bay eventually lost.<br><br>
        Sunday, I once again set up my ice fishing shack and gave it a try.  I didn’t have any luck but it was a good time.  Tiff and Andrew went over to Kim’s to use her sauna.  For supper we grilled chuck-eye steaks.<br><br>
    Monday, after dropping Andrew off at theater practice, I tried ice fishing again with no luck.  Someday I’m going to get a couple Walleyes:)<br><br>
